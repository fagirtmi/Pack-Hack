 * 1. Search for something on the website, such as 'a'
 * 2. Open up the developer console (For Chrome, press control + shift + I)
 * 3. Paste the code in the console
 * Incremental sleep was added due to the website's really slow response time. Looking at network tab shows
 * how it cancels if the button is clicked before the website responds. Without this, it may never load.
 * Website becomes extremely slow (20+ second response times) for larger data sets such as S.
